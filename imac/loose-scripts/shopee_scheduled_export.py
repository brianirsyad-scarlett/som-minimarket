"""
Unattended daily export: for each Shopee shop on this account, downloads two
order reports:
  - "month_to_date": day 1 of the current month -> today
  - "previous_month": day 1 -> last day of the previous month

Each report is saved as plain .xlsx file(s) directly into that shop's
"Seller Data" destination folder (see SHOP_DESTINATIONS) -- if Shopee returns
a .zip (large shops get split into multiple part files), it's unzipped in
place and only the .xlsx entries are kept, flattened straight into the
destination (no extra subfolder, no leftover .zip).

After both shops are downloaded, every .xlsx in each "Seller Data" folder is
converted to .csv into the sibling "Shopee Star"/"Shopee Mall" folder (mirrors
the existing csv_converter.py in each of those folders), and finally both
combined Parquet files (Shopee.parquet, Shopee_bq.parquet) are rebuilt from
all historical CSVs via shopee_parquet_converters.py.

Stale month-to-date files (yesterday's date range, now superseded by today's)
are deleted before writing fresh ones -- on both the .xlsx and .csv side --
so they don't pile up daily. previous_month files aren't touched this way
since their filename is stable all month and simply overwrites in place.

Meant to be triggered once a day at 00:00 Asia/Jakarta by a LaunchAgent (see
com.brian.shopee-export.plist). Reuses the persisted login profile from
shopee_export_orders.py (~/.shopee_seller_profile) headlessly -- it does NOT
prompt for login, since nobody's watching at midnight. If the saved session
has expired, it logs an error and exits; run shopee_export_orders.py by hand
to log in again.

Shopee's report system rejects a new report request if the previous one was
started less than ~1 minute ago, so requests here are spaced with a minimum
gap (MIN_GAP_SECONDS) regardless of how many shops/periods are queued.
